## Basic Calculations

1. At a restaurant, you order:
   - 1 soup for $10
   - 3 burgers for $8 each
   - 1 ice cream for $5
   
   Use JavaScript to calculate the total cost of the order.

3. Calculate a 10% tax for the total in exercise 2.

4. Calculate a 20% tax for the total in exercise 2.
   > Remember: 1% = 1/100, so 20% = 20/100 = 0.2

## Shopping Cart Exercise

## Temperature Conversion Challenge

The formulas for temperature conversion are:
- Fahrenheit = (Celsius × 9/5) + 32
- Celsius = (Fahrenheit - 32) × 5/9

10. The temperature is 25°C. Calculate the temperature in Fahrenheit.

11. The temperature is 86°F. Calculate the temperature in Celsius.

12. The temperature is -5°C. Calculate the temperature in Fahrenheit.
